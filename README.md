# Cats-Dogs-SMML-SIA
Binary classification and image generation of cats and dogs.

The following is a report of the project developed for the Statistical Methods For Machine Learning course 
along with Sistemi Intelligenti Avanzati course at University of Studies of Milan, during the academic year 2021-2022. 

The project compares the performances of different neural networks trained for the task of binary classification
of images of cats and dogs taken from a dataset, with the use of cross-validation. Furthermore, it proposes 
a way to generate new images of cats and dogs, starting from the same dataset using a Generative Adversarial Network.
